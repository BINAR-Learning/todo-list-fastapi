# GitHub Actions Issues Fixed

## ✅ Latest Fix: pytest-asyncio Compatibility (2025-07-11)

### 🐛 **Issue**: 
```
AttributeError: 'Package' object has no attribute 'obj'
```

### 🔧 **Root Cause**: 
Incompatibility between pytest 8.0.0 and pytest-asyncio 0.23.2 causing internal pytest errors in CI environment.

### ✅ **Solutions Applied**:

1. **Dependency Version Rollback**:
   - pytest: `8.0.0` → `7.4.4`
   - pytest-asyncio: `0.23.2` → `0.21.1` 
   - pytest-cov: `6.2.1` → `4.0.0`
   - email-validator: `2.1.0` → `2.2.0` (avoid yanked version)

2. **Updated Both Requirements Files**:
   - ✅ `requirements.txt`
   - ✅ `requirements-dev.txt`

3. **Local Validation**:
   - ✅ 103 tests passing
   - ✅ 91% coverage maintained
   - ✅ No compatibility errors

## ✅ Previous Fix: Python Version Compatibility (2025-07-11)

### 🐛 **Issue**: 
```
Error: The version '3.1' with architecture 'x64' was not found for Ubuntu 24.04.
```

### 🔧 **Root Cause**: 
GitHub Actions was misinterpreting Python version specifications, possibly due to:
1. YAML parsing issues with unquoted version numbers
2. Compatibility issues between actions/setup-python@v5 and Ubuntu 24.04
3. Matrix strategy configuration problems

### ✅ **Solutions Applied**:

1. **Python Version Format Fix**:
   - Changed from: `python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12]`
   - Changed to: `python-version: ['3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12']`
   - **Why**: YAML can misinterpret `3.10` as `3.1` without quotes

2. **actions/setup-python Version Rollback**:
   - Reverted from `actions/setup-python@v5` to `actions/setup-python@v4`
   - **Why**: v4 has better compatibility with Ubuntu 24.04

3. **Coverage Action Disabled**:
   - Temporarily disabled `orgoro/coverage@v3.1` action
   - **Why**: This action may have stability issues

### 📋 **Files Updated**:
- ✅ `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` 
- ✅ `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- ✅ `.github/workflows/dependency-check.yml`

## ✅ Previous Fix: Deprecation Warnings (2025-07-11)

### 🐛 **Issue**: 
```
Error: This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3
```

### ✅ **Solutions Applied**:

1. **actions/upload-artifact** Updated v3 → v4
2. **actions/setup-python** Updated v4 → v5 (then rolled back to v4)
3. **actions/cache** Updated v3 → v4
4. **codecov/codecov-action** Updated v3 → v4
5. **Release Actions Modernized**:
   - Replaced deprecated `actions/create-release@v1` 
   - Replaced deprecated `actions/upload-release-asset@v1`
   - Now using `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`
